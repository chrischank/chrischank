Thank you for visiting my Github :). I have been a ```~soydev~``` since 2019. Learn programming they say, it will be fun they say... Now that I have sunk an irreversable amount of time and soul in, it might be too late to recover :(. I just hope that I can be a 5x dev by the end of my life and a few forks and stars edge onto my gravestone. I'll be happy as long as I can take my vim config to heaven with me ☁️.

#### My general incompetencies are...
- 🛰️ Satellite imagery and geospatial analysis
- 👀 Computer Vision and CNN
- 💁 Generalist data stuffs in your usual stack
- 📈 Scientific plotting and LaTeX
- 🐈 Going overboard with my neovim / zsh / kitty setup

#### Non-coding incompetencies...
- 🧻 I have a weeny amount of paper [published](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher-Chan-15?ev=hdr_xprf), mostly refugee camps mapping and resilience research
- ⛰️ I like sports, climbing, running, and touching grass
- 🚋 Hobbyist urban planner, mostly practicing in Cities Skyline

- In the pinned tabs you can checkout my sample code that nobody will ever read again, as well as my config files, which are probably more useful to you.
- For actual portfolio of things that I can barely do, see my [website](https://story.chanakin.info/)
